# Engineering

> If you apply, we'd love you to tell us about the most challenging engineering problem you’ve worked on.

## Engineers on the team today:

- Work in TypeScript primarily. As we begin to implement E2E encryption/key management, federated graph protocols, and more – we see a bright future in Rust; In-browser (wasm), in-app, and for decentralized graph database reference implementations (open source).
- Are naturally curious and willing to take a step to learn something they don’t have experience in
- Empower and support—especially when teammates are faced with new challenges
- Take initiative to figure out the solutions to their challenges and ask for help to collaborate constructively
- Feel a great sense of accountability to each other
  Uphold best practices in engineering, security, and design

## Skills & Experience

- We seek passionate and skilled developers with a high degree of emotional intelligence who are looking to make a difference in how people learn and make sense of the world. We have a wide variety of systems engineering and UI challenges running the gamut from database internals, inverted indices, cryptography, graph drawing, and UI workflows.
- It doesn’t matter if you have one year of experience or thirty – applicants should be very comfortable in Rust, with a good grasp of Computer Science fundamentals and Typescript.

### About the job

Do you ever feel overwhelmed by the amount of information you’re exposed to every day? Have you ever tried to read something and had difficulty focusing due to distractions or “noisy” thoughts? How many browser tabs do you have open right now?

At Edvo, we envision a world where people are empowered to think well. We're creating tools to help us make better sense of information and transform passive consumption into active thinking. We aim to incrementally reshape a broadcast-biased information economy into one of neighborly exchange, where information silos are torn down and knowledge is collaborative.

To achieve this, we must carefully consider first-principles of cognitive science, human-computer-interaction, privacy, trust, and business ethics.

Making sense in the information age and organizing our lives within it is about connections, and yet another walled-garden app will not do. In order to achieve our goal, we have to help foster an ecosystem that’s bigger than Edvo itself. We have to both build in public and also put forth a protocol which allows personal knowledge graphs to become interpersonal.

We’re small, but scrappy – and we need your help to achieve this mission. Today, our prototype utilizes Typescript, React, and Firebase. As we begin to implement E2E encryption/key management, federated graph protocols, and more – we see a bright future in Rust; In-browser, in-app, and for decentralized graph database implementations. We have a strong interest in building in public, and in promulgating an open source ecosystem.

We seek passionate and skilled developers with a high degree of emotional intelligence who are looking to make a difference in how people learn and make sense of the world. We have a wide variety of systems engineering and UI challenges running the gamut from database internals, inverted indices, cryptography, graph drawing, and UI workflows.It doesn’t matter if you have one year of experience or thirty – Applicants should be very comfortable in Rust, with a good grasp of Computer Science fundamentals, and at least a passing knowledge of wasm, javascript, and typescript.
